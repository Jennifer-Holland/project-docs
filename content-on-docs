Please start writing down which content specifically on MS Docs picked your interest the most and can be improved on (lack of content, difficulty, it doesn't fit with the
new student mindset)

Jennifer's Ideas:
Microsoft Security - For the "Governance, risk and compliance" area, there is a long list of videos and then one very long article - could split up the article into 
                     individual articles like other sections of this area (see Privileged Administration for an example) and link between videos and article(s) because at the moment
                     the layout is very confusing. Other areas of Microsoft Security are formatted the same but have less content and so are easier to understand.
Microsoft Edge - No glossary/terminology page.
Microsoft Graph - No glossary/terminology page.
